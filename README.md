The application provides **role-based access control (RBAC)** for roles such as `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `MANAGER`, and `SCIENTIST`. It uses **JWT-based authentication** for secure login and token management. The system ensures dynamic communication between frontend and backend using **AJAX/Fetch API**. Logging and efficient query handling with Hibernate JPQL ensure high performance and maintainability.
